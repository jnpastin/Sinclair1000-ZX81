# TS1016 16K External RAM Expansion Module
Depending on the version of the system, these machines had either 1K or 2K of internal RAM.  This was obviously pretty limiting, so the TS1016 was created.  This provided a full 16K of RAM, disabling the internal RAM.  The expansion module relies on DRAM instead of the SRAM that was used internally.

The design of these was fairly simple.  I was not able to find any schematics online, so I reverse engineered it, and uploaded my findings here.  Each unit consists of two PCBs linked by a 22 conductor ribbon cable.  One board houses the logic, mostly addressing and such, typical glue logic.  The other houses the DRAM chips and the power supply.  The 4116 DRAM chips require +12V, +5V, and -5V, so the module has to create them from the unregulated +9V available on on the card edge connector.  My unit came populated with ITT 4116-3 (200ns access time), however, I was only able to source TI 4116-4 (250ns access time) ICs.  I have not encountered any issues associated with the different brand or timing.  

The Arduino script ran on a Nano with no issues, and is designed to test individual RAM ICs.  It assumes external power supplies, as Arduino's cannot generate the required voltages.  Overall it was a straightforward breadboard setup.
